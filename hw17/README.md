## 3. Describe Possible Solutions for Each Type

To mitigate peak loading issues, Goal.com can implement a multi-layered approach:

### General Solutions Applicable Across Multiple Page Types:

* **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
    * **Description:** Distribute static and dynamic content globally.
    * **Benefit:** Reduces latency, improves load times, offloads origin servers, and provides DDoS protection.
    * **Example:** Using Cloudflare or Akamai to cache assets and serve them from the nearest edge server to a user in Lviv during a Champions League match.
* **Robust Hosting Infrastructure & Load Balancing:**
    * **Description:** Scalable cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling and load balancers.
    * **Benefit:** High availability and responsiveness during peak loads. Horizontal scaling handles massive traffic.
    * **Example:** Employing AWS Elastic Load Balancing or Google Cloud Load Balancing to distribute traffic among multiple application servers.
* **Aggressive Caching Strategies:**
    * **Browser Caching:** Leverage browser caching for static assets.
    * **Page Caching:** Cache full HTML pages for a certain duration.
    * **Object Caching:** Cache database query results and API responses in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
    * **CDN Caching (Edge Caching):** Utilize the CDN's caching capabilities for static and dynamic content.
    * **Example:** Caching the list of top football leagues for a short duration using Redis.
* **Database Optimization & Scaling:**
    * **Description:** Optimize queries, use indexing, and consider replication (read replicas) and sharding.
    * **Benefit:** Prevents database bottlenecks during high traffic.
    * **Example:** Implementing read replicas for the database serving live scores.
* **Code Optimization & Performance Tuning:**
    * **Description:** Optimize backend and frontend code for efficiency and faster rendering.
    * **Benefit:** Reduces server processing time and improves overall responsiveness.
    * **Example:** Minifying CSS and JavaScript files.
* **Asynchronous Operations & Queues:**
    * **Description:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for non-critical background tasks.
    * **Benefit:** Prevents background tasks from impacting website responsiveness.
* **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**
    * **Description:** Limit the number of requests from a single IP or user.
    * **Benefit:** Protects against abusive bot traffic and prevents individual users from overwhelming the server.

### Solutions Specific to Page Types:

* **Homepage:**
    * **Heavy Caching:** Cache aggregated content with near real-time updates for critical sections.
    * **Prioritize Critical Content:** Ensure important information loads first.
* **Article Pages:**
    * **Page Caching:** Cache full article content, especially for older articles.
    * **Lazy Loading for Media:** Load images and videos only when visible.
* **Live Score/Match Center Pages:**
    * **WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE):** For efficient real-time updates.
    * **Optimized Data Feeds:** Scalable and low-latency backend systems for live data.
    * **Differential Updates:** Send only the changes in live data.
* **Team/Player Pages:**
    * **Caching of Statistics and Information:** Cache frequently accessed data.
* **Video Pages:**
    * **CDN for Video Delivery:** Optimized CDN for video streaming.
    * **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** Adjust video quality based on network conditions.
* **Social Media Integration Pages:**
    * **Asynchronous Loading:** Load social media feeds without blocking main content rendering.
    * **Caching of Feeds:** Cache retrieved social media data.
* **Web Store/E-commerce Pages:**
    * **Caching of Product Listings:** Cache product information and category pages.
